#Introduction to Oldfox.

= Introduction =

Oldfox is a simple tool for those who want to check from where a server is located on the face of the earth. There are several Web based services who used to show the path travailed by the mail or a server.


= Details =

This project depends on 
  * *sqlite3* database engine
  * *[http://www.maxmind.com Maxmind]* city level data in csv format

= How to setup =

The setup process is easy.
  # get the csv files from maxmind
  # execute the script preparemaxmind.sh
  # install sqlite3 and sqlite3-devel
  # from sqlite prompt execute following sql queries
  # CREATE TABLE city_block (startip integer, endip integer, locid integer);
  # CREATE TABLE city_loc (locid integer, country text, region text, city text, postalcode text, latitude float, longitude float, metrocode text, areacode text);
  # Now import the 2 files which are converted in step 2 to the respective tables.
  # compile the oldfox.c file( gcc -o oldfox oldfox.c -lsqlite3 ) and you are done.

= Using Oldfox =
  * To see the path to a server/ remote machine
    # Using traceroute: use the script traceroute.sh remote_machine outputfile
    # Using MTR: use the script mtr.sh remote_machine outputfile
    # then execute oldfox outputfile

The output will be in a tabular form showing each IP, city, region, country, latitude and longitude.

= Future enhancements =
  * Display on a world map may be through a browser( need help in this)
